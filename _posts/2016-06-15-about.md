# BERLO

Established 2003

[Berlo][0] is a crossdomain practice dedicated to create Land and Building Value Inheritance and Golden Mean Design Living, using artistic and architectural means and processes. Our master believe is that great projects have strong aesthetic, functional and cultural ideas clad onto a core vision, engaged by both the client and maker, and able to create life and prosperity to the inhabitants and the surrounding community. With each project we push for simplicity and harmony, all with respect for environment and site value, and like establishing relationships that can build and develop future grounds.

### Eugen Bogdan Berlo

Principal Eugen Berlo takes the lead role in each project within the studio and fully oversees all aspects from concept and design development, to implementing and site supervision. With Bachelors in Math and Architecture from the University of Bucharest, he continued his education in Fine Arts at Fashion Institute of Technology of NYC. Prior to inception of [BERLO][0], he worked as an architect for some of the New York City's most eminent architectural firms, including world's highly renowned Skidmore, Owings and Merrill (SOM) architectural, planning and Engineering company.
