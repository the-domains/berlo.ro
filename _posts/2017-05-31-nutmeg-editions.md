Nutmeg Editions is a printing and publishing studio specialising in hand lithography, intaglio and relief printing. It was set up by Sanju Mathew. Nutmeg Editions welcomes and encourages innovative and experimental approaches to printmaking. We can guide and facilitate both experienced and relatively inexperienced printmakers; prior understanding of specific techniques is not a necessity. Nutmeg deals with all the practicalities of the printmaking process from start to finish. The technical support artists receive allows them the freedom and the confidence to develop ambitious ideas should they wish to.
