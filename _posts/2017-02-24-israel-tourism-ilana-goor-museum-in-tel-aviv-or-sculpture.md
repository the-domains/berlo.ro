# Sculpture at Ilana Goor Museum

For the first time in Israel, you have the opportunity to admire works of art from the point of view of the artist/collector rather than as exhibits in a sterile academic environment.

The [Ilana Goor Museum ][0]is located in an 18th century building surrounded by the breathtaking landscape of the shoreline of Tel Aviv and the [Old Jaffa City][1]. Fascinating historical events are ensconced within the Museum's walls dating back to 280 years ago, when the building served as the first Jewish Inn for pilgrims on their way to Jerusalem. The Museum was restored based on its original building and boasts over 500 Israeli, international and Ethnic Art alongside Ilana Goor's creations.

In the Museum there is a large and fascinating collection of sculptures of various sizes, forms and materials, which were sculpted in different time periods by Ilana Goor, international artists, veteran and young Israeli artists. Amongst them are sculptures by the English sculptor Henry Moore, the Italian sculptor Diego Giacometti and the Russian sculptor Archipenko (Sculpture Room) as well as Yaakov Agam's kinetic sculptures (Main Atrium), Yaacov Dorchin's monumental sculptures (Design Room) and works by Yigal Tomarkin (Main Atrium) together with authentic sculptures by Dr Yosef Sapir, Ilana Goor's grandfather (Library) and ancient Christian sculptures made of olive wood (Christian Room). Through our website, you can get a sense of some of the unique sculptures displayed exclusively in the Museum, and of the various spaces in which each and every painting is exhibited
