  Giuliana was born in Seravezza near Pietrasanta, Tuscany. Between 1962 and
  1968 she was a student at the Istituto D’Arte Stagio Stagi in Pietrasanta,
  gaining a Master of Arts Diploma.This was followed by a further four years
  studying painting at the Accademia di Belle Arti in Carrara. She moved to
  Yorkshire in 1987 and now lives in York. The Tuscan landscape and childhood
  memories still bear a strong influence upon the artist’s current work. In an
  earlier statement she describes her first encounters with Art in Italy as a
  child in her father’s mosaic studio. She refers to the “translucency of the
  mosaic fragment” and her “fascination with the vibrancy of colour” from the
  juxtaposition of pieces. Her current works show an economy in terms of
  compositional design, with richness of surface mark and colour, reconfirming
  the artist’s earlier delight in light and transparency.
