# ArPhiTect

Established by Eugen Berlo in 2015, [ArPhiTect][0] is an architectural practice and crossdomain venture dedicated to explore and work within Value Inheritance and Golden Mean Geometric Principles using artistic and architectural means and processes. Our master believe is that great projects have strong aesthetic, functional and social ideas clad onto a core vision, engaged by both the client and maker, and able to create life and prosperity to the inhabitants and the surrounding community. With each project we push for simplicity and innovation, all with respect for environment, and site cultural and material values, and like establishing relationships that can build and develop future grounds.
