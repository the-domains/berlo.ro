# Pioneers of Modern Chinese Painting

[Sotheby's][0]
![ “ Pandas only come in black and white, they are pretty lazy. This is how I depict my pandas: they are fat, they have an open heart, their black and white colours are clearly delineated, and they live among stalks of bamboos. But I don’t paint pandas for the sake of the pandas. What I want is to juxtapose bold black grids embracing pudgy white grids, tossing and turning … Pandas inspire me to search for disarray and eternity.” – Wu Guanzhong](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/10f79ecf-63ee-498c-8c4f-943f0071067d.jpg)
![During the autumn of 1979, Wu Guanzhong travelled to Changsha to create his large oil painting Shaoshan. Afterward, he travelled to Western Hunan to Fenghuang to paint its beauteous landscapes. There he had the sudden urge to paint in Zhangjiajie. This is how he recalled that journey: “It was a simple road for vehicles for the purposes of forest protection. It was pretty bumpy, lined with stones and pebbles. Lorries would jerkily move along the road …](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/a3bd5837-140a-4f94-9064-6dcaf2cf3ffb.jpg)
![These two works belonged to the founder of the Asia Society, Mr and Mrs John D.Rockefeller 3rd. They were originally gifts from Mr and Mrs Henry Luce, the founder of Time and Life magazines. Luce (1898–1967) was a staunch supporter of the Nationalist government during the Second World War, even visiting China in May 1941, meeting with Chiang Kai-shek in Chongqing...](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/b8ecd07c-c659-41a0-9835-76eed0bf91c0.jpg)
![Although this work is not dated, looking at the style of the brushstrokes, signature and stamp, we can deduce it dates from the 1950s, comparable to Ladies in a Garden belonging to the Hong Kong Museum of Art. The treatment, especially the fine brushwork depicting every flower and plant, can only be traced to a short period during the painter’s career that never recurred afterward....](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/4515ce14-4f50-447f-9cf6-81d18c0ef3af.jpg)
![This series originates from noted Shanghai art connoisseur Wang Yiping’s collection. Lin Fengmian left Shanghai for Hong Kong in October 1977. Two years later, Lin wrote to Wang Yiping and other friends, informing them that he wanted to donate the 105 paintings he left in Shanghai’s China Art Academy to the Chinese government. ...](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/d4b97e31-0c6c-4718-82ec-ee591b04af76.jpg)
![This work belongs to the Cheng Xin Xuan Collection of 19th and 20th century paintings. Although the canvas was not signed, according to written records, it dates from 1957.](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/d80c0e13-614d-49e6-b47b-ad86895fa0c8.jpg)
![The water towns of Jiangnan with its winding rivers and bridges, no matter whether the hometown of Lu Xun or the famed locale of Yixing, are frequent subjects of Wu Guanzhong’s output of the 1980s. Although this work belongs to that period, it is unusual in its composition and approach. In the foreground is a stone bridge that cuts across the width of the work with the river flowing below. ...](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/2382f3f3-0db3-4d9c-94a0-a428af7a804a.jpg)
![This painting was a gift from Xu Beihong to Li Rumian. During the Korean War, the painter suffered from bad health, finishing only a few works, although he tried his best to put ink on paper. This painting depicts a horse galloping in mid-air, as if it could traverse a thousand miles in a day. It is testament to Xu’s immense level of energy of that moment. Perhaps this was given to Li as a token of support during the time when China was standing on the opposite side of America on the Korean peninsula...](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/a28a454a-2ec6-4d27-9bcd-a47b0452bf80.jpg)
